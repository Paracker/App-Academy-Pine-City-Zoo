                        <h3>PENGUINS</h3>
                        <p>They spend about half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea. The largest living species is the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri):[6] on average, adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb).</p>
                        <p>Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds from the family Spheniscidae</p>
                        <p>There was a great diversity of species in subantarctic regions, and at least one giant species in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, during the Late Eocene, a climate decidedly warmer than today.[9]</p>
                        <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                        <p>You will find them with the White (Polar) Bears.</p>
